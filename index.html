          I believe that if you show people the problems and you show them the
          solutions, they will be moved to act. The more difficult the
          challenge, the more people should be inspired to rise above it and
          find innovative ways to address it. It’s not enough to simply point
          out what’s wrong; we must also work together to fix it.
